As Computers cant understand normal data so we change it to computer understandble code i.e Binary bits. During transmission, digital signals suffer from noise that can introduce errors in the binary bits travelling from sender to receiver.
The project checks whether there are any errors in the binary bits at receiver side.
we have used simple parity check technique for error detection.
Technologies Used :HTML,CSS,JavaScript
